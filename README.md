- For my past homework assignment, I created the Jungle Cook website to make it fully functional. I utilized JSON to manage the data, stored in a local folder. The JSON file was a key element in this project. To implement CRUD operations, I ensured the ability to create a recipe. Navigating through the website was achieved with jQuery, which dynamically replaced the window hash to reflect the currently injected view. The structure of each page remained simple, using basic HTML for seamless accessibility.
